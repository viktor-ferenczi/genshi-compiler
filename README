Genshi Compiler - Template compiler mostly compatible with Genshi's syntax

https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/genshi-compiler/

Installation: python setup.py install

Genshi Compiler allows for compiling simple Genshi XML templates
to pure Python code. You can render the whole template or any of
the template functions by importing generated code. The generated
code is typically ~40x faster than rendering the same via Genshi.
There is a cost of this speedup. Some of Genshi's dynamic
features are not available, most notably anything that depends
on a template loader (xi:include), the XML element tree
representation (py:match) or the token stream (filters).
Language translation (i18n) support is currently limited
to simple text inside the translatable elements and attributes
and the i18n:msg directive.
